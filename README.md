## ‚≠ê IWA_2.4 Challenge 3

<!-- omit in toc -->

### Challenge

"_The following code should print a warning to the console, indicating that security scanning has started. It should also print an info message to the console, informing users that they should wait for the scan to complete before closing the browser. It is important that these comments are kept in the code for context to future developers._

_Currently, the code fails to even run at all."_

```
//
It is important to show the following message in order to:
- to assure users
- to scare hackers
- to impress investors
//

console.warn(Security scan starting)

/* It is important to let user know when they can close the page  /*

cnosole.info('Please wait for scan to complete before closing the browser.)
```

<!-- omit in toc -->

### My Solution

1. I corrected the multi-line comment syntax
2. I changed the warning into a `string`
3. I corrected the single-line comment syntax
4. I corrected the `console.info()` syntax and the closed the string with the missing quotation mark
